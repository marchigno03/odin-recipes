    <hr>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>⅞ cup Arborio rice</li>
        <li>¾ cup Prosecco</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped fresh strawberries</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soft goat cheese (chevre)</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Grana Padano cheese</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step
            <p> Warm broth in a saucepan over low heat.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 2
            <p>At the same time, heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add rice and stir until fully
                coated with oil and pale gold in color, about 2 minutes. Pour in Prosecco and stir constantly until wine
                is fully absorbed.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 3
            <p>Add 1/2 cup warm broth and stir until broth is absorbed. Add 1/2 cup broth and strawberries; stir until
                absorbed. Add 1/2 cup broth, Grana Padana cheese, and goat cheese; stir until absorbed. Continue adding
                broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender yet firm to
                the bite. Stirring in the broth should take about 18 minutes in all. Turn off the heat and allow to rest
                2 minutes before plating.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 4
            <p>Divide rice onto 2 plates and top each with 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
