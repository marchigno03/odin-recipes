        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p> Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Set aside.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Mix water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast begins to form a creamy foam,
                    about 5
                    minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Stir half the flour mixture into yeast mixture until no dry spots remain. Stir in remaining flour,
                    1/2
                    cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. When dough pulls together, turn it out onto a
                    lightly
                    floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light
                    cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in
                    volume,
                    about 1 hour. Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form each into a ball.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Preheat oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Stretch out and pat 1 dough ball to form a circle 10 to 12 inches in diameter. Place dough on a
                    lightly
                    floured pizza peel. Top with 1/2 cup of tomato sauce and spread to cover within an inch of the edge
                    of
                    the dough. Arrange 5 slices of mozzarella cheese on top of the tomato sauce, then place 5 basil
                    leaves
                    on top. Drizzle pizza with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt to taste. Repeat for 3
                    remaining dough balls.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Slide each pizza onto the pizza stone in the preheated oven. Bake until cheese is bubbly and the
                    underside of the crust is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
